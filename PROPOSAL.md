# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

David Jobin
       
# Intentions:

I set out to create a single or multiplayer, civ-like strategy game, focused on diplomacy and management.
The players control nation-states and compete against "AI" (Randomly controlled) opponent nations.
The goal is to demonstrate national superiority through one of two ways:
       By Eliminating all rival nations,
       By Having more than 2000 wealth.
# Intended usage:

Each player turn will represent a year of running their country.
Play will be divided into phases, each dedicated to controlling certain aspects of the nation,
such as the economy, alliances with others, and war.
The gameplay will consist of typing into the prompt and looking at numbers in charts, and at
rudimentary maps of battlefields.

# Technical Details:

Each player country will be a client, connecting to the server, which runs the AIs.
Files will be used to store regional data and troop movements.


# Intended pacing:

1/7: Completion of the structures needed to handle nations and their domestic actions.
1/9: Completion of diplomatic features.
1/11: Completion of war mechanics and land seizure.
1/16: Fine-tuning of gameplay complete.

# Back-up plan for downsizing (Just in case)

Singleplayer nation sim.
