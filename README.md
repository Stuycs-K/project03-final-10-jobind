### Project Description:

This is a light-weight, singleplayer, nation-based strategy game, with minimal economic and military mechanics, and simple win conditions.
The player runs a country, hell-bent on being better than the others. Luckily, the non-player nations are controlled through chance,
so with careful thought and knowledge of mechanics, the player can consistantly win.
*It's text-based and turn-based.
  
### Instructions:

Just use make run! No args or libraries necessary.
The user interacts by typing. And hitting enter. Avoid using ctrl+D.
